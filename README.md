Choose your own adventure for Application Development 
This story is based around YOU! The player who is on the hunt for eyesight. 
The story follows a tale of elves and gnomes and their war over eyesight.
You, The player, gets to make choices to see how you want to get your eyesight back! 

This is a fairly odd story but it is very whimiscal and fun!
